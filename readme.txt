About: These scripts demonstrate how to compress Javascript, and are based on the article here: http://betterexplained.com/articles/optimized-javascript-example/

Usage:

1) makeall.bat: Packages files into a single library, compresses javascript (requires java), and adds the cache header
2) sample.html: Examples of loading Javascript files (inline, imported, and delayed)
